- **MAC Address:** 00:0C:29:0B:F9:0B
- **OS:** Linux Kernel 2.6 on Ubuntu 8.04 (hardy)

## Vulnerabilities

### 1. Apache Tomcat AJP Connector Request Injection (Ghostcat)

- **Synopsis:** Vulnerable AJP connector listening on the remote host.
- **Description:** A file read/inclusion vulnerability was found in the AJP connector, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to read web application files or gain remote code execution.
- **Solution:** Update the AJP configuration to require authorization and/or upgrade the Tomcat server to 7.0.100, 8.5.51, 9.0.31, or later.
- **Risk Factor:** High
- **CVSS v3.0 Base Score:** 9.8

### 2. Bind Shell Backdoor Detection

- **Synopsis:** The remote host may have been compromised.
- **Description:** A shell is listening on the remote port without authentication, posing a critical risk.
- **Solution:** Verify if the remote host has been compromised and reinstall the system if necessary.
- **Risk Factor:** Critical
- **CVSS v3.0 Base Score:** 9.8

### 3. Debian OpenSSH/OpenSSL Package Random Number Generator Weakness

#### 3.1 SSH Host Keys Weakness

- **Synopsis:** The remote SSH host keys are weak.
- **Description:** The remote SSH host key has been generated on a Debian or Ubuntu system with a weak random number generator, allowing an attacker to decipher the remote session or set up a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Solution:** Regenerate all cryptographic material on the remote host.
- **Risk Factor:** Critical
- **CVSS v2.0 Base Score:** 10.0

#### 3.2 SSL Certificate Weak Key

- **Synopsis:** The remote SSL certificate uses a weak key.
- **Description:** The remote x509 certificate on the remote SSL server has been generated on a Debian or Ubuntu system with a weak random number generator, allowing an attacker to decipher the remote session or set up a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Solution:** Regenerate all cryptographic material on the remote host.
- **Risk Factor:** Critical
- **CVSS v2.0 Base Score:** 10.0
